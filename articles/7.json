{"ID": 7,  "Cat": "Test", "Title": "Git : Opening a pull request", "Created": "14jun23", "Author": "A3", "Content": "Now that you have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.\n\nPull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.\n\nAs soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.\n\nBy using GitHub's @mention feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or 10 time zones away.\n\nYou can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It's a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.\n"}
