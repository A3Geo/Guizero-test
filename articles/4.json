{"ID": 4, "Cat": "Test",  "Title": "AI Art based on stolen data", "Created": "14jun23", "Author": "A3", "Content": "but those large AI companies that have recently come to popular success (like Midjourney) have stolen literally hundreds of millions of training examples to train their AI model and they don't even try to hide it, they brag about it. When they were stealing data to make free open AI models that just made low quality funny memes it was all fun and games, but now they're closed source and asking for money to do the work of those they stolen works from. In particular with AI art, there are now tutorials on how to remove watermarks and artist signatures which have leaked in from the stolen training images so that you can 'make a business charging for your images as an AI artist', this is truly disgusting to me. 2023 will be the year of AI training data litigation, private art feeds, tag vandalism, intentional training data contamination, increased DMCA on image boards, and the end of many creators posting online at all. There are now websites that index the known datasets of stolen works those AI companies use, a lot of works I've posted have been stolen (and your too Dave, EEVBlog forum posts, video thumbnails and frames and flickr images), I can see why so many are privating their works and no longer posting because all they would be doing is supplying free training data for those AI companies and immoral 'AI artists' looking to clone an artist's work and style.\n"}
