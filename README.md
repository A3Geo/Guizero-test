# Guizero-test
A simple CMS (Content Management System) coded in Python.

Content (articles) is implemented as files in JSON format.
The GUI is made using the GuiZero library

I created this to learn (more) Python and I could use a simple and portable note taking application. *Learning by doing !*

Project is still in very early stages and has been tested with just a small number of files

'features' implemented :

- creating articles in the GUI
- listing them
- selecting & viewing them
- editing them
- searching them
- saving them as JSON

todo :

- deleting articles
- categories (add, edit, delete, filter)
- etc.
